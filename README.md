# Building-a-Comprehensive-Security-Home-Lab: Active Directory, Splunk SIEM, and Threat Simulation
Currently the longest and most beneficial project I worked on. Building a local Splunk SIEM, creating a new domain with Active Directory, and attacking a Windows machine with Kali Linux and running ART Atomics.
